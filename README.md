# ðŸ¤– Reddit Notification Bot ðŸ¤–

A Reddit bot that uses Python and PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) to send the user a notification, via Reddit inbox, of a new post in any existing subreddit. 

## About

This is one of my first side projects that I am proud to make and share with you guys. Learning how to make a reddit bot was not only fun but helped me gain the knowledge and experience with using an API/API wrapper for the first time. If there is any errors or improvement that you want to make to this don't hesitate to request a pull. I would love to collaborate with other people and learn :-)
